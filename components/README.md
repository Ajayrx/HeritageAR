# Components

This folder contains reusable UI components for the Heritage AR app.

## Current Components

Currently, the app uses built-in Lucide React Native icons for a clean, minimalist design approach. The main AR logo is implemented using the `Scan` icon with custom styling and animations.

### Design Philosophy
- **Simplicity**: Clean, recognizable icons that don't distract from content
- **Performance**: Lightweight components with optimized animations
- **Consistency**: Unified design language throughout the app
- **Accessibility**: Clear, high-contrast visual elements

### Future Components
This folder is ready for custom components as the app grows and requires more specialized UI elements.
